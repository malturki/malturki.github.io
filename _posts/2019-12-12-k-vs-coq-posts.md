I posted a series of articles [here](https://runtimeverification.com/blog/k-vs-coq-as-language-verification-frameworks-part-1-of-3/) (also on [Medium](https://medium.com/coinmonks/k-vs-coq-as-language-verification-frameworks-part-1-of-3-19ff603b4e91)) comparing K and Coq as language verification frameworks through a working example. It's in three parts:
