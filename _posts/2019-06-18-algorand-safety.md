I posted an article celebrating the successful completion of the first part of an ongoing collaboration between [Runtime Verification](https://runtimeverification.com/) and [Algorand](https://www.algorand.com/), to model Algorand's consensus protocol and verify its safety theorem using the [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) proof assistant].
